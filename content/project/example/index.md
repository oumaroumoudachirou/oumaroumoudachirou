I examine the macroeconomics implications of emission offset prevision as a means for regulated firms to comply with emissions regulation by using less expensive offset credits. I document an increase in the use of offset credits and a positive correlation with firms size and then, develop and calibrate a general equilibrium model for California Cap-and-Trade. The model considers discrete choices of heterogeneous greenhouse gas emitters between offset credits and using standard regulatory payment instruments. By using offset credits, firms negotiate the cost of permits with sellers, resulting in an unknown price to the regulator. As a result, I show that  offset provision under a regulated offset market is welfare-enhancing with an aggregate output increase and this, irrespective of the cap. The aggregate net emissions reduce by 6% along with aggregate TFP gain of 0.10%. However,  allowing for unregulated international offset credits inefficiently decrease output without a clear national emission reduction due to the matching frictions and the risk of credits rejection by the regulator. This give a role for a cap on the use of offset credits to mitigate the inefficiency. The efficiency gain from the optimal cap is equivalent to x percent of output.  The calibrated model is used to assess how main results changes under multiple considerations and policy scenarios.
