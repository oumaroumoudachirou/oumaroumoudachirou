 Threshold based exemption in environmental regulation is a provision that excludes emitters with emissions below a certain threshold.  I study the long-run implication of this policy on aggregate output, TFP and emissions. Using establishments data on pollution, I document that 40% to 50% of firms are exempted, with evidence of clustering around the cut-off, primarily driven by new entrant firms. Exiting firms tend to be closer to the threshold compared to their incumbent peers. I use an industry dynamic model featuring heterogeneous firms and a carbon pricing system that allows for threshold specific exemption. The model is calibrated to California and shows that removing the exemption leads to 1.9% output gain due to resource reallocation toward productive firms. The model assesses the implications under alternative policies: a partial-exemption where firms pay for emissions above the threshold, and a full-exemption policy akin to a laissez-faire scenario.  Given the exemption threshold, I derived a characterization for the second-best carbon tax under different policy scenarios within a simplified model.
